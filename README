These are my (Alex Lindsay's) instructions for building the arcos executable and the libconfig libraries. The source code in this repository is taken from the Multiscale Dynamics Group at CWI (https://scm.cwi.nl/MD/arcos).

Dependencies: FFTW, which is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions. The source for FFTW can be obtained from http://www.fftw.org/download.html

Build procedure: 

First we build the libconfig libraries which are used for reading, manipulating, and writing arcos input/output files. The homepage for libconfig can be found at http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/ 

1) Enter arcos root directory

2) cd libconfig-1.4.9

3) ./configure

4) make

5) make install (may have to run "sudo make install" depending on your permissions)

Now we build the arcos executable

6) cd ..

7) mkdir arcos_f90/lib

8) mkdir fish90/lib

9) make all

You should now see the arcos executable in your root arcos directory! For instructions on how to use the arcos executable, please go to CWI's documentation at http://cwimd.nl/other_files/arcos_html/md_MANUAL.html#sect_software
