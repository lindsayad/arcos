To create the executable arcos:

- first create library libconfig.
  Go to directory libconfig-1.4.9/lib  and give the following command
  make all

- next, return to the root directory pharcos and give the following command
  make all

Now you have the executable arcos, which needs the input files from
directory input. ./arcos also needs an output directory. The name is given in 
/input/default.cfg by "output_dir". Here we chose directory output. 

If output does not exist, create this directory:
make output

In this directory many files for visualization will be written. For more details see the documentation:

file:///?????
